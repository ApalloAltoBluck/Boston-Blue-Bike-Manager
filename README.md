# CS 3200(DATABASE DESIGN) final project

For our final, we based our CRUD application on the Boston Blue Bike API. This application utilizes a MySQL, Express, React and Node.js stack and relies on a database with three domain objects. 

### HOW TO CONNECT TO DATABASE

- create a .env file at the root of the project with the following values
  `host= (eg:localhost)
  user= (eg:root)
  password= (eg:your_password)
  database= (eg:my_final_password)`
  
### HOW TO START
- Launch two terminals
- Terminal one: `npm install` then `npm start`
- Terminal two: `cd client` then `npm install` then `npm start`
